# Phase Two 


- give me explicit instructions for cloning and getting your app running, and tell me if it has been tested only on mac or windows. Pretend I am a child who has never cloned a ruby app before

- if you have time do a screen recording of a walkthrough of your app, then even if something breaks between now and marking I can mark all the features

- make sure I can get into your github repo by making it public or inviting me
